EdgeX device service for REST protocol

This device service provides easy way for 3'rd party applications, such as Point of Sale, CV Analytics, etc., to push data into EdgeX via the REST protocol. 

## Runtime Requisite

- core-data
  - Mongo or Redis DB
- core-metadata

## REST Endpoints

This device service creates the additional parametrized `REST` endpoint:

```
/ap1/vi/resource/{deviceName}/{resourceName}
```

- `deviceName` refers to the `device` defined in a `device profile` and the `configuration.toml`.
- `resourceName`refers to the `device resource` defined in the `device profile` that `deviceName` references.

The data, `text` or `binary`,  posted to this endpoint is type validated and type casted (text data only) to the type defined by the specified `device resource`. The resulting value is then sent into EdgeX via the Device SDK's `async values` channel. 

> *Note: When binary data is used the EdgeX event/reading is `CBOR` encoded by the `Device SDK` and the binary value in the reading is`NOT` be stored in the database by `Core Data`. The `CBOR` encoded event/reading, with the binary value, is published to the `Message Bus` for `Application Services` to consume*

> *Note: All non-binary data is consumed as text. The text is casted to the specific type of the specified `device resource` once it passes type validation.*

## Configuration

This device service use the standard configuration defined by the **Device SDK**. 

The `DeviceList` configuration is standard except that the `DeviceList.Protocols` can be empty. The following is a sample `DeviceList` that works with the sample device profiles referenced below.

```toml
[[DeviceList]]
  Name = "sample-json"
  Profile = "sample-json"
  Description = "RESTful Device that sends in JSON data"
  Labels = [ "rest", "json" ]
  [DeviceList.Protocols]
    [DeviceList.Protocols.other]
[[DeviceList]]
  Name = "sample-binary"
  Profile = "sample-binary"
  Description = "RESTful Device that sends in binary data"
  Labels = [ "rest", "binary" ]
  [DeviceList.Protocols]
    [DeviceList.Protocols.other]    
[[DeviceList]]
  Name = "sample-numbers"
  Profile = "sample-numbers"
  Description = "RESTful Device that sends in number data"
  Labels = [ "rest", "float", "int" ]
  [DeviceList.Protocols]
    [DeviceList.Protocols.other]
```

## Device Profile

As with all device services the `device profile` is where the **Device Name**, **Device Resources** and **Device Commands** are define. The parameterized REST endpoint described above references these definitions. Each `Device` has it's own device profile. There are three sample device profiles that define the devices referenced in the above sample configuration.

- **[sample-binary-device](./cmd/res/)**
- [**sample-json-device**](./cmd/res/sample-json-device.yaml)
- [**sample-numbers-device**](./cmd/res/sample-numbers-device.yaml)

> *Note: The`coreCommands` section is omitted since this device service does not support Commanding. See below for details.* 

> *Note: The `deviceCommands` section only requires the `get` operations.*

## Testing/Simulation

The best way to test this service with simulated data is to use **PostMan** to send data to the following endpoints defined for the above device profiles.

- http://localhost:59995/resource/sample-binary/binary

  - POSTing any binary data will result in the `BinaryValue` of the `Reading` being set to the binary data posted.

- http://localhost:59995/resource/sample-json/json

  - POSTing a string value will result in the  `Value` of the `Reading` being set to the string value posted.

    *Note: Currently there isn't a JSON data type, thus there is no validation that the string value is valid JSON. It is up to the Application Service using the JSON to first validate it.*

- http://localhost:59995/resource/sample-numbers/int
  - POSTing a value will result in the  `Value` of the `Reading` being set to the string representation of the value as an `Int64`. The POSTed value is verified to be a valid `Int64` value. 
  - A 400 error will be retuned if the POSted value fails the `Int64` type verification.
- http://localhost:59995/resource/sample-numbers/float
  - POSTing a value will result in the  `Value` of the `Reading` being set to the string representation of the value as an `Float64`. The POSTed value is verified to be a valid `Float64` value. 
  - A 400 error will be retuned if the POSted value fails the `Float64` type verification.

## Commanding

The current implementation is meant for one-way communication into EdgeX. If future use cases determine that `commanding`, i.e. two-communication, is desirable it can be added then.

## AutoEvents

Since `Commanding` is not implemented, specifying `AutoEvents` in the configuration will result in errors. Thus `AutoEvents` should not be specified in the configuration.

## Installation and Execution

```bash
make build
make run
```

## Build docker image

```bash
make docker
```
